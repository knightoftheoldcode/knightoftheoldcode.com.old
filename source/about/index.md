Spendlove. Yup. `/spend/ - /l…ôv/` It sounds just like it's spelled. One can imagine the jokes. And I surrounded myself with friends who thought the jokes were much more humorous when we were teenagers than when we were adolescents.

I'm a husband, father, author, and coder. During the daytime I write mind-numbingly large enterprise applications to put steak on the table. When the sun sets I don my tights and cape and work on smaller, personal projects...the culmination of which have recently added a salt and pepper shaker to the table.

(I don't <strike>really</strike> **usually** code in tights or a cape.)

I first knew I was destined to write code when I shipped my first Macintosh application in the 90's. I was irritated by dying continually in Descent. So, I wrote Descent Saved Game Editor. DSGE followed the UNIX tradition: do one task and do it well...allow the user to hack their saved games with vastly superior armor, weaponry, and ungodly quantities of ammunition.

Below is a quick (randomized) spattering of adulation from individuals in various roles of my life.
If this isn't enough to convince you that I'm awesome, please feel free to [read more][koc-raving-fans].

<div>If you care about your team's culture then Curtis is a must have member. He brings character and humility with him, not to mention a great work ethic. I was grateful to have been successful in recruiting him to our team. While he won't gab your ear off all day long he certainly gels well with a team and does a fantastic job of contributing to our tech discussions and decisions. As a leader, Curtis showed great patience when working with others as well as being fully committed and accountable for his projects.</div>

<p>While Curtis may appear stepped in java experience he actually has been able to deploy a variety of technologies. He showed us his ability to apply good practices while diving deeper into ruby and the rails framework. And for all his ability to guide and explain to others he is equally capable at being taught.</p>

<p>I look forward to the opportunity to work with Curtis again.</p>

<div class="alert alert-light">
Well-spoken, passionate, great personality, and an expert of his craft. I have had the pleasure of working with Curtis and I would highly recommend him. He is very humble and truly has a well thought out plan of his goals and interests in relation to his career and his family. He is extremely loyal and is the type of developer that embraces new challenges, does not cut corners, and will meet and/or exceed all expectations put in front of him. Curtis is an expert coder who can also lead and mentor. He is definitely someone you want on your team.

I have known Curtis for many years. He is loyal, friendly and very smart. He has always loved computers and has worked hard to become a great developer. I respected his abilities so much that I recommended him for a position working with me a few years ago. He was a great addition to our team. He worked well on his own and with others, leading younger developers and collaborating with more experienced ones. Curtis is a great coworker, a valuable employee and a very capable leader.
